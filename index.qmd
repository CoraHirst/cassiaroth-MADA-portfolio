### About Me

I am an MPH student in Epidemiology in the College of Public Health at the University of Georgia (UGA). I am also an Associate Professor of History and Latin American and Caribbean Studies in the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences at UGA. I received my PhD in Latin American History with a Concentration in Gender Studies from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2016. I study the history of reproductive health in Latin America, in particular Brazil. In 2021, I decided to start an MPH in Epidemiology to learn data analysis skills that I could employ in my study of the historical roots to current trends in cesarean section rates in Brazil. 

I have experience with Stata and SAS, as well as some experience with R and RStudio. I have statistical knowledge in linear and logistic regressions as well as epidemiological measures of association.

I would like to come out of this class with an intermediate working knowledge of R and RStudio, as I hope to run all future statistical tests in R. After completing the activities for this first week, I also realize how much I want to learn about streamlined workflows and best practices in data management, including best naming practices.

Quirky fact about me: I love digging up invasive species in my yard.
